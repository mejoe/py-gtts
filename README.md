# Python text to speak scripts for kids

Simple scripts for kids to learn a little about programming in a fun way. The intention with this repo is to engage kids on the power and fun of programming.

I suggest a quick overview for kids on the following:

- That computers need to be told what to do through programs
- Programmers write the programs
- Programs are everywhere including phones, computers, cars, tvs, just about everything!

## Requirements:

- python 3.0 or later (install is based on OS)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- install gps using pip: `pip install gtts`

## Script descriptions:

- **helloworld.py** we are starting with the basics here
- **speak.py** use the google text to speach api to turn text into spoken word
- **jokes.py** interact with a random joke api
- **sayjokes.py** tie it all together to say random jokes from the internet.
